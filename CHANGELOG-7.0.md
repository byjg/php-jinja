# Changelog - Version 7.0

> **Status: in development.** This document tracks changes landing on the `7.0` branch.
> Nothing here is released yet, and the contents may still change.

## Breaking Changes

- None.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 are now supported: `"php": ">=8.3 <8.7"`.
  The previous `<8.6` upper bound excluded PHP 8.6, since `<8.6` is exclusive.

## Toolchain

- PHPUnit updated to `^12.5`.
- Psalm is installed as `psalm/phar` (`^6.16`) instead of `vimeo/psalm`.

  `vimeo/psalm` lists the PHP versions it supports and no published release includes
  8.6, so as a dev dependency it made `composer install` fail on the 8.6 build job
  before any test ran. `psalm/phar` requires only `php ^8.2` and bundles its own
  dependencies, so it installs on every PHP version in the matrix and cannot conflict
  with the project's. Psalm itself still refuses to *run* on 8.6, which is why the
  Psalm job uses 8.5. `composer psalm` runs it.

  PHPUnit 13 is deliberately **not** used. It requires PHP `>=8.4.1`, which would
  break the 8.3 floor.

## Continuous Integration

- The build matrix now includes PHP 8.6.
- The Psalm job now runs on PHP 8.5. Psalm declares
  `~8.1.31 || ~8.2.27 || ~8.3.16 || ~8.4.3 || ~8.5.0` and therefore does not run on
  PHP 8.6.

## Housekeeping

- `phpunit.xml.dist` renamed to `phpunit.xml`.
- Added the `LICENSE` file (MIT); the license was already declared in `composer.json`.
